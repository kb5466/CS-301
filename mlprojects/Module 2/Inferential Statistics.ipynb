    "The sampling distributions of many statistics of interest look similarly symmetric and bell-shaped. An important mathematical result, the Central Limit Theorem, specifies the conditions for which a statistic's sampling distribution will approximately follow a normal distribution. The **Central Limit Theorem** (CLT) states that if random samples of size  are drawn from a large population and  is large enough, then the sampling distribution of the sample mean will follow approximately a normal distribution. The CLT also applies to proportions since a proportion can be expressed as the mean of zeros and ones.\n",
